# Welcome to the Kigs framework page

Kigs framework is a C++ modular multipurpose cross platform framework. [Assoria](http://assoria.com/) used it as a basis for many projects. The main goal was to be able to develop different types of applications (games, simulators, viewers...) quickly, in a totally independent manner (without any "black box").

We decided to first open source the framework for Windows ( x86 , x64 , for openGL and D3D, UWP D3D ) and HTML5 (Emscripten) platforms. Other platforms ( iOS, Android, Linux... ) are still private but could also be opened in the future.

The main IDE to build current platform is Visual Studio C++ 2019.
