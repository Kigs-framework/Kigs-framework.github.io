### Some news

A big code refactoring was finished a few weeks ago.
Here are some of the main changes :
- added namespaces
- xml and setter/getter from string use \[ \] instead of { } for arrays
- added mapped attributes (CoreModifiable attributes mapping existing member variable )
...

And for what's going on right now :
As maintaining android platform in visual studio seems more or less dead, I'm trying to generate Android Studio projects and update old Android code ( with a lot of JNI / Java ) to use recent version of the NDK.
